~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   BUGS  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*category page - categories with a large text get cut off by the view, 

*disable edit and trash when there are no item in all sections

*add "add new item" screen when there is no item in all sections but category

*In Add Item page, if there are no category, redirect user to create category before create item, or some other option.
need to make user create a category before they can create and item.

*Create Item Category selection needs to be changed from an input box to something else, looks dumb

*If category name is to large, the checkbox still gets kicked out of the highlighted area. looks bad 

*If Recipe tite is to long it overflows, need to give max width
