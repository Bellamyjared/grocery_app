```future features to add  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*category page - need to add category order

*need to edit pantry to add pantry features. just a stripped mimic of list right now

* need to add error txt boxes, and alerts

* if pantry has the an item, highlight it in recipe.

* if all items in recipe are highlighted, highlight the title.

*add a feature to turn recipe highlights off

*add feature to disable pantry

*add google-sign-in without expo go,

*add server is unreachable try and catches

*Need animated transition

testing a git push

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   BUGS  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*If category is deleted, items with that category need to be deleted from all use cases.

*disable edit and trash when there are no item in all sections

*add "add new item" screen when there is no item in all sections but category

*Create Item Category selection needs to be changed from an input box to something else, looks dumb

*If category name is to large, the checkbox still gets kicked out of the highlighted area. looks bad
